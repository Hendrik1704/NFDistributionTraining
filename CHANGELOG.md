# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The versioning of the codebase is inspired by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with a version number `X.Y.Z`, where

* `X` is incremented for major changes (e.g. large backwards incompatible updates),
* `Y` is incremented for minor changes (e.g. external pull-request that adds one feature) and
* `Z` is incremented for the indication of a bug fix or other very small changes that are not backwards incompatible.

The main categories for changes in this file are:

* `Input / Output` for all, in particular breaking, changes, fixes and additions to the in- and output files;
* `Added` for new features;
* `Changed` for changes in existing functionality;
* `Fixed` for any bug fixes;
* `Removed` for now removed features.

A `Deprecated` section could be added if needed for soon-to-be removed features.
